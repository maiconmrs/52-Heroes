# Welcome to the #52 Heroes

This project was created within a 4 days (including the planning day) pair project, where the objective was to create a simple but fun card game, for we used colleagues from class 52 of the Codaisseur Academy as models for our heroes in the cards. The project is built with JavaScript, using the React library and the framework Redux for data management, and the sltyling with CSS.
